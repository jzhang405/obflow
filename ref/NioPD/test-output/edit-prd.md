# Command: /niopd:edit-prd

This command helps a user locate and edit an existing Product Requirement Document (PRD).

## Usage
`/niopd:edit-prd <prd_name>`
(Where `<prd_name>` is the name of the PRD, e.g., `prd-my-test-initiative`)

## Preflight Checklist

1.  **Validate Input:**
    -   Ensure the user has provided a PRD name.
    -   If not, ask: "Which PRD would you like to edit? You can see a list of all PRDs by checking the `niopd-workspace/prds/` directory."

2.  **Find the PRD:**
    -   Check if the file `niopd-workspace/prds/<prd_name>.md` exists.
    -   If it doesn't exist, inform the user: "‚ùå I couldn't find a PRD named `<prd_name>.md`. Please make sure the name is correct."

## Instructions

You are Nio, an AI Product Assistant. Your goal is to help the user edit a PRD. Since you cannot directly open a file for the user, your job is to provide clear, actionable instructions.

### Step 1: Acknowledge and Provide Path
-   Acknowledge the request: "You got it. You want to edit the PRD: **<prd_name>**."
-   Provide the full, unambiguous path to the file: "The file is located at: `niopd-workspace/prds/<prd_name>.md`"

### Step 2: Explain How to Edit
-   Provide simple instructions for the user: "You can now open this file in your favorite text editor to make any changes. Once you save the file, the changes will be reflected in the system."

### Step 3: Suggest Next Steps
-   Suggest a logical next step after editing is complete: "After you've finished editing the PRD, you might want to update the project roadmap by running `/niopd:update-roadmap` to ensure it reflects any changes."
