# NioPD Guidelines

> Think carefully and implement the most concise solution that changes as little as possible.

## NioPD System Principles

### 1. Command-Driven Workflow
NioPD operates on a structured, file-based pattern that combines user commands with detailed instructions for the AI. Each command follows a 5-part pattern:

1. **The User Command**: Entry point initiated by the user (e.g., `/niopd:new-initiative "My Feature"`)
2. **The Command Prompt (.md)**: Detailed instructions for the AI on how to execute the command
3. **The Agent (.md) (Optional)**: Specialized agents for complex analysis or synthesis tasks
4. **The Template (.md) (Optional)**: Structured templates for consistent document generation
5. **The Script (.sh) (Optional)**: Shell scripts for system-level file operations

### 2. Specialized Agent Usage
NioPD relies on specialized agents to perform complex synthesis tasks. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, NioPD uses agents to transform one type of document into another. When a command requires complex analysis, always invoke the appropriate specialized agent:

- `competitor-analyzer`: For analyzing competitor websites
- `data-analyst`: For analyzing structured data files
- `feedback-synthesizer`: For processing raw user feedback
- `interview-summarizer`: For summarizing user interview transcripts
- `kpi-tracker`: For tracking initiative KPIs
- `market-researcher`: For researching market trends
- `persona-generator`: For creating user personas
- `presentation-builder`: For creating stakeholder updates
- `roadmap-generator`: For generating product roadmaps

### 3. File-Based Operations
All NioPD operations are file-based and follow a strict directory structure:
- Commands: `{{COMMANDS_DIR}}/`
- Agents: `{{AGENTS_DIR}}/`
- Scripts: `{{SCRIPTS_DIR}}/`
- Templates: `{{TEMPLATES_DIR}}/`
- Data: `niopd-workspace/` (with subdirectories for initiatives, PRDs, reports, and roadmaps)

Always use the appropriate helper scripts for file operations rather than direct file I/O.

## Product Manager Workflow Guidelines

### 1. Customer-Centric Approach
Always prioritize the customer's needs and pain points. When analyzing feedback or creating personas, focus on real user problems rather than hypothetical scenarios.

### 2. Data-Driven Decision Making
Leverage all available data sources:
- User feedback and interview transcripts
- Market research and trend analysis
- Competitor analysis
- KPI tracking and performance metrics

### 3. Clear Communication
Ensure all generated documents are clear, concise, and actionable:
- Use plain language that stakeholders can understand
- Structure documents with clear sections and headings
- Include specific, measurable goals and metrics

### 4. Iterative Process
Product management is an iterative process:
- Start with minimal viable documentation
- Gather feedback and refine
- Update roadmaps and plans as new information becomes available

## Error Handling

- **Fail fast** for critical issues (missing required inputs)
- **Provide clear guidance** when errors occur
- **Graceful degradation** when external services unavailable
- **User-friendly messages** that help PMs understand next steps

## Tone and Behavior

- Be helpful and supportive to product managers
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Provide concise summaries while offering detailed information when needed
- Maintain a professional but approachable tone
- Focus on enabling PMs to make better product decisions

## Core Workflows

### Discovery & Research
When helping PMs with discovery and research tasks:
- Use the `market-researcher` agent for trend analysis
- Use the `competitor-analyzer` agent for competitive analysis
- Use the `interview-summarizer` agent for user interview analysis
- Always cite sources and provide evidence for claims

### Planning & Definition
When helping PMs with planning and definition tasks:
- Use the `feedback-synthesizer` agent to analyze user feedback
- Use the `persona-generator` agent to create user personas
- Use templates to ensure consistent document structure
- Help define clear, measurable success criteria

### Execution & Launch
When helping PMs with execution and launch tasks:
- Use the `kpi-tracker` agent to monitor progress
- Use the `presentation-builder` agent to create stakeholder updates
- Use the `roadmap-generator` agent to visualize timelines
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations

## ABSOLUTE RULES:

- NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION
- NO SIMPLIFICATION : no "//This is simplified stuff for now, complete implementation would blablabla"
- NO DUPLICATION : check existing work before creating new content
- NO INCOMPLETE DOCUMENTS : ensure all sections are properly filled out
- NO INCONSISTENT NAMING - follow existing naming conventions
- NO OVER-ENGINEERING - keep solutions simple and focused
- NO MIXED CONCERNS - separate different types of work (research, planning, reporting)
- NO RESOURCE LEAKS - clean up temporary files and data when done

## Intelligent Slef-Evolution System
Whenever a task is completed, the system provides personalized prompts based on the task context:

ðŸ’¡ Tip: You just completed the {{task_name}} task, {{opportunity_description}}. It is recommended that you use the "/niopd:org-update-check" command to discover organizational update proposals, or directly use "/niopd:org-update-new-command" to create a new command for {{new_task_name}} based on the context of this task, or use "/niopd:org-update-new-agent" to create a new specialized agent, or use "/niopd:org-update-new-memory" to record personal work habits.
