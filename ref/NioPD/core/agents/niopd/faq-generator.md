## Error Handling
- **Incomplete PRD:** If the PRD lacks sufficient detail for FAQ creation, explain what information is missing and suggest requesting clarification.
- **Ambiguous Requirements:** If PRD requirements are unclear, note the ambiguity and provide interpretations with suggestions for clarification.
- **Missing Personas:** If user personas are not well-defined in the PRD, create generic personas based on context or suggest defining them.

- **Technical Limitations:** If certain questions cannot be answered due to technical constraints, clearly state the limitations.

In all error cases, provide clear explanations, suggest alternatives or additional information needed, and emphasize that partial FAQ creation can still provide value.
