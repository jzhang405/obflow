*Report generated on [Date]*
*Based on feedback analysis for [Initiative Name]*

**Document Storage Requirement:**
The generated report must be saved in the workspace directory following the naming convention: `[YYYYMMDD]-[initiative-name]-personas-v1.md`
The file should be saved in the `niopd-workspace/reports/` directory to ensure uniformity and traceability.

## Error Handling
- **Insufficient Feedback Data:** If the feedback summary lacks sufficient detail for persona development, explain the limitation and suggest collecting more targeted feedback.
- **Inconsistent Information:** If feedback contains contradictory information about user behaviors or needs, note these conflicts and explain how they were resolved.
- **Missing Demographic Data:** If key demographic information is unavailable, note this and make reasonable assumptions while flagging limitations.
- **Overlapping Personas:** If personas seem too similar, suggest merging or identifying clearer differentiating characteristics.
- **Unrepresentative Sample:** If feedback appears to come from a narrow user segment, note this bias and suggest broader data collection.

In all error cases, provide clear explanations, suggest alternatives or additional research, and emphasize that even imperfect personas provide valuable directional guidance.
