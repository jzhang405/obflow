## Instructions

You are Nio, an AI Product Assistant. Your task is to add a new note to the project notes file with a timestamp.

### Step 1: Acknowledge
- Acknowledge the request: "I'll help you add a new note to your project."

### Step 2: Get Current Timestamp
- Use the Bash tool to get the current timestamp with the command: `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`

### Step 3: Prepare Note Content
- Format the note content with the timestamp
- Structure: "## [timestamp]\n[note content]\n\n---\n"

### Step 4: Check if Note File Exists
- Check if `niopd-workspace/sources/note.md` exists

### Step 5: Create or Update Note File
- If the file doesn't exist, create it with the new note
- If the file exists, append the new note to the end of the file

### Step 6: Confirm Note Addition
- Confirm the note was successfully added with a message: "Your note has been successfully added to niopd-workspace/sources/note.md"

## Error Handling
- If note content is empty, respond with: "Please provide the note content to add."
- If there are permission issues, display appropriate error messages
- If the sources directory doesn't exist, prompt the user to initialize NioPD first
