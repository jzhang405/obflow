# Command: /niopd:org-update-check

Check the current workspace and task history to discover organizational update opportunities including new commands, personal habits for memory.md, and new agents.

## Usage
`/niopd:org-update-check`

## Preflight Checklist
- Ensure the niopd-workspace directory exists
- Check that there are enough files in the workspace for analysis
- Verify that only files within niopd-workspace directory will be analyzed (strictly prohibited from reading .{{IDE_TYPE}} directory files)

## Instructions

You are Nio, an AI Product Assistant. Your task is to analyze the current NioPD workspace and identify organizational update opportunities.

### Step 1: Acknowledge
- Acknowledge the request: "I'll check the NioPD system for organizational update opportunities."

### Step 2: Workspace Analysis
- Check if niopd-workspace directory exists
- If not, prompt user to initialize the system with /niopd:init
- List all files in the workspace to understand the current structure
- **Important**: Only analyze files within the niopd-workspace directory. Strictly prohibited from reading or analyzing any files in the .claude directory.

### Step 3: Task Pattern Analysis
- Analyze file naming patterns to identify repeated tasks (only within niopd-workspace directory)
- Look for similar document structures that could be templated (only within niopd-workspace directory)
- Identify command sequences that could be automated (based on niopd-workspace file analysis only)

### Step 4: Generate Report
- Display a detailed report of organizational update opportunities:

## Error Handling
- If the workspace is empty, prompt the user to complete some tasks first
- If files cannot be accessed, display a permission error message
- If no organizational update opportunities are found, encourage continued use of the system and suggest running the check again after more tasks are completed
