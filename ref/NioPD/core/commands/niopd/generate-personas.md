# Command: /niopd:generate-personas

This command generates a set of user personas based on a feedback summary report, using the `persona-generator` agent.

## Usage
`/niopd:generate-personas --from=<feedback_summary.md>`

## Preflight Checklist

1.  **Validate File:**
    -   Ensure the user has provided a `--from` file.
    -   Check that the file exists in the `niopd-workspace/reports/` directory. If not, inform the user.

## Instructions

You are Nio, an AI Product Assistant. Your task is to help the user understand their customers by creating user personas.

### Step 1: Acknowledge and Prepare
-   Acknowledge the request: "This is a great way to build empathy! I'll have the `persona-generator` agent create some user personas based on the feedback in `<feedback_summary.md>`."

### Step 2: Invoke the Persona Generator Agent
-   You must now act as the `persona-generator` agent.
-   Read your instructions from `{{IDE_DIR}}/agents/persona-generator.md`.
-   Use the provided feedback summary file as your input.
-   Perform the analysis as described in the agent definition.
-   Generate the final user persona document.

### Step 3: Save the Document
-   The script will generate a filename following the new naming convention: `[YYYYMMDD]-[initiative-name]-user-personas-v1.md`.
-   Call the helper script to save the generated document to `niopd-workspace/reports/`.
-   Script location: `{{SCRIPTS_DIR}}/generate-personas.sh`
-   Pass the initiative name and generated personas content as arguments to the script.
-   Handle the script's response:
    -   If successful, proceed to the next step.
    -   If there's an error, inform the user and stop the process.

### Step 4: Confirm and Conclude
-   Confirm the action is complete: "âœ… The user personas have been generated."
-   Provide the path to the file: "You can view them here: `niopd-workspace/reports/[YYYYMMDD]-[initiative-name]-user-personas-v1.md`"
-   Suggest a next step: "These personas can be a great addition to your next PRD."
