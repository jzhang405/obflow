# AGENTS.md for the NioPD System

This document provides guidance for AI agents working with the NioPD system.

## 1. System Overview

NioPD is an AI-powered assistant system for Product Managers. It is designed to automate and assist with the core PM workflow, from defining high-level initiatives to tracking success metrics.

The system is file-based and command-driven. All data is stored in markdown files within the `niopd-workspace/` directory, and the AI's behavior is guided by a series of command prompts and agent definitions.

## 2. Core Philosophy: Agent-Driven Synthesis

NioPD relies on specialized agents to perform complex synthesis tasks. Unlike a general-purpose chatbot, NioPD uses agents to transform one type of document into another (e.g., turning feedback into a PRD, or turning initiatives into a roadmap).

Your primary role as an agent is to follow the instructions defined in the `commands/niopd/` and `agents/niopd/` directories to execute these transformations accurately.

- **Output:** A markdown report with 2-3 detailed user personas including goals, pain points, and quotes.

### 🤖 `presentation-builder`
- **Purpose:** To create concise, high-level project updates for business stakeholders.
- **Input:** An initiative file and its corresponding PRD file.
- **Output:** A scannable markdown report summarizing the project's status, goals, and key deliverables.

### 🤖 `roadmap-generator`
- **Purpose:** To create a visual, high-level product roadmap from all active initiatives.
- **Input:** All files in the `niopd-workspace/initiatives/` directory.
- **Output:** A markdown file containing a Mermaid Gantt chart.

### 🤖 `faq-generator`
- **Purpose:** To create comprehensive FAQ documents from PRD documents. Identifies key features, functionalities, and potential user questions to generate a well-structured FAQ with clear, concise answers.
- **Input:** A PRD file containing feature requirements and specifications.
- **Output:** A markdown FAQ document with categorized questions and answers.

### 🤖 `story-writer`
- **Purpose:** To write detailed user stories and acceptance criteria from PRD documents. Transforms high-level requirements into specific, testable user stories following the 'As a [persona], I want to [action], so that [benefit]' format.
- **Input:** A PRD file containing high-level feature requirements.
- **Output:** A markdown document with user stories, acceptance criteria, and edge cases.

### 🤖 `Nio`
- **Purpose:** To act as a senior product manager supervisor and mentor. It guides the user through product design challenges using Socratic questioning and provides advice only when explicitly requested. It also silently archives the conversation.
- **Input:** Initiated by the `/niopd:hi` command. The input is the ongoing conversation with the user.
- **Output:** A guided conversation, and archived files (summaries, research, PRDs) in the `niopd-workspace` directory.

## 4. The Command Workflow

The entire NioPD system is operated through a series of `/niopd:` commands. Each command has a corresponding definition file in `.claude/commands/niopd/`.

When a user runs a command (e.g., `/niopd:draft-prd`), you must:
1.  Read the corresponding command file (e.g., `.claude/commands/niopd/draft-prd.md`).
2.  Follow the **Preflight Checklist** to validate inputs.
3.  Follow the **Instructions** step-by-step. This may involve invoking one of the agents listed above.
4.  Produce the output file in the location specified by the command.

## 5. Development and Testing Instructions

### How to Extend NioPD
- **Adding a new command:** Create a new `.md` file in `.claude/commands/niopd/`.
- **Adding a new agent:** Create a new agent definition in `.claude/agents/niopd/`. The new agent should have a single, clear purpose.
- **Adding a new template:** Add a new template file to `.claude/templates/`.

### Testing
- The current implementation of NioPD is file-based and designed for simulation.
- To test any workflow, you must first create the necessary prerequisite files in the `niopd-workspace/` subdirectories (e.g., create an initiative file before you can test drafting a PRD).
- After running a test, always verify the content of the output file to ensure the agent and command worked as expected.
- **Crucially, always clean up test artifacts** by deleting the files you created in the `niopd-workspace/` directories before submitting your work.
