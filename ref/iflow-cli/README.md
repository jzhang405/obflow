## 🚀 Getting Started

To launch iFlow CLI, navigate to your workspace in the terminal and type:

```shell
iflow
```

### Starting New Projects

For new projects, simply describe what you want to create:

```shell
cd new-project/
iflow
> Create a web-based Minecraft game using HTML
```

### Working with Existing Projects

For existing codebases, begin with the `/init` command to help iFlow understand your project:

```shell
cd project1/
iflow
> /init
> Analyze the requirements according to the PRD document in requirement.md file, and output a technical document, then implement the solution.
```

The `/init` command scans your codebase, learns its structure, and creates an IFLOW.md file with comprehensive documentation.
