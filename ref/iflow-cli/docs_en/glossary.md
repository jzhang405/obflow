| **API Key** | Authentication key for connecting to XinLiu AI services | Generated in settings page |
| **Workspace** | Current directory environment where iFlow CLI is executed | `cd project/` |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol, server system for extending AI capabilities | `/mcp`
| **Sub Agent** | Intelligent Agent system suitable for executing different professional tasks | `/agents`
| **Sub Command** | Command line extensions | `/commands`

### Command System

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Slash Commands** | Built-in control commands in iFlow CLI starting with `/` | `/init`, `/help`, `/clear` |
| **Shell Commands** | System commands executed in CLI starting with `!` | `!ls`, `!npm install` |
| **@File Reference Commands** | File reference @filepath| `@src/App.tsx`|
| **$Subagent Execution Commands** | Execute a subagent starting with `$` | e.g. `$code-reviewer` |
| **Natural Language Instructions** | Instructions for direct conversation with AI in natural language | `> Analyze this project structure` |

### Execution Modes

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|----------|
| **yolo** | Default execution mode that allows CLI to perform all operations | Use shift + enter to switch modes|
| **plan mode** | CLI will first plan tasks and require manual confirmation before execution | Use shift + enter to switch modes|
| **default mode** | Mode where all operations require user confirmation | Use shift + enter to switch modes|
| **accepting edits** | Mode where the model automatically executes file creation and modification, other operations still require user confirmation | Use shift + enter to switch modes|

### Interaction Modes

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Multi-line Input** | Multi-line text input created using `\` or `Shift+Enter` | `line1 \` `line2` |
| **Image Paste** | Paste images into CLI using `Ctrl/Cmd+V` | `[Pasted image #1]` |
| **File Reference** | Reference files or directories using `@` symbol | `@src/app.js` |
| **Placeholder** | Simplified display identifier generated by system for large content | `[Pasted text #1 +45 lines]` |

## Extension System

### MCP Related

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|----------|
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol, communication standard between AI and external tools | Model Context Protocol |
| **MCP Server** | External tools or services that implement the MCP protocol | playwright-mcp, file-system-mcp |
| **stdio Server** | MCP server that communicates through standard input/output | Local Python scripts |
| **SSE Server** | MCP server based on Server-Sent Events | Web API services |

### Agent System

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Sub Agent** | AI assistant specialized in handling specific domain tasks | Code review agent, documentation generation agent |
| **Agent Configuration** | Configuration file defining sub agent behavior and capabilities | `.iflow/agents/config.json` |
| **Task Distribution** | Mechanism for assigning complex tasks to different specialized agents | Automatically select appropriate agents |

## Features

### Memory and State

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Context** | Background information for AI assistant to understand current conversation | Project structure, conversation history |
| **Content Import** | Import information from external files into AI context | `@README.md` |
| **Checkpoint** | Function point for saving current session state | Save important conversation nodes |
| **Session History** | Complete record of current conversation | Can be cleared with `/clear` |

### Advanced Features

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Observability** | Function for collecting and analyzing system runtime data | Usage statistics, performance monitoring |
| **Multimodal** | Ability to simultaneously process multiple data types like text and images | Image understanding, document analysis |
