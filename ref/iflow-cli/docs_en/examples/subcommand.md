## How It Works

### Command Marketplace Architecture

```
Online Marketplace ‚Üí Local Installation ‚Üí CLI Integration ‚Üí Slash Commands
    ‚Üì               ‚Üì                ‚Üì              ‚Üì
[Command Library] ‚Üí [TOML Config] ‚Üí [Command Parsing] ‚Üí [Function Execution]
```

### Scope Hierarchy

- **Global Scope**: Installed to `~/.iflow/commands/`, available to all projects
- **Project Scope**: Installed to `{project}/.iflow/commands/`, only available to current project

## Command Configuration Files

### TOML File Structure

Installed commands generate local TOML configuration files:

```toml
# Command: code-reviewer
# Description: Professional code review tool supporting multi-language code quality detection
# Category: Development
# Version: 2
# Author: iflow-community

description = "Professional code review tool supporting multi-language code quality detection"

prompt = """
You are a professional code review expert. Please analyze the code provided by the user and evaluate from the following aspects:

1. Code quality and readability
2. Security issue detection
3. Performance optimization suggestions
4. Best practice compliance
5. Potential bugs or logical errors

Please provide specific improvement suggestions and example code.
"""
```

### Markdown File Structure

In addition to TOML format, iFlow CLI also supports Markdown format configuration files.

```bash
# Create command directory
mkdir -p ~/.iflow/commands

# Create Markdown format command file
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.iflow/commands/security-review.md
```

You can also add descriptions, for example:
```markdown
---
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

### Configuration File Locations

| Scope | Configuration Path | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Global | `~/.iflow/commands/` | Accessible to all projects |
| Project | `{project}/.iflow/commands/` | Only accessible to current project |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Command installation failure | API key not set or expired | Re-authenticate |
| Command unavailable | CLI not restarted to load new configuration | Restart iFlow CLI |
| Permission error | Insufficient directory permissions | Check file system permissions |
| Network connection failure | Cannot access command marketplace API | Check network connection and firewall settings |
| Command conflict | Same-named commands in different scopes | Use --scope to specify explicitly |

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Connection Check**
   ```bash
   # Test API connection
   /commands online
   
   # Check authentication status
   /auth status
   ```

2. **Configuration Verification**
   ```bash
   # View local command list
   /commands list
   
   # Check configuration file
   cat ~/.iflow/commands/command-name.toml
   ```

3. **Permission Verification**
   ```bash
   # Check directory permissions
   ls -la ~/.iflow/commands/
   ls -la ./.iflow/commands/
   ```

4. **Log Check**
   ```bash
   # View detailed logs
   /log
   
   # View error information
   /debug
   ```

### Cleanup and Reset

```bash
# Clean project-level commands
rm -rf ./.iflow/commands/

# Clean global commands (use with caution)
rm -rf ~/.iflow/commands/

# Reinitialize command configuration
iflow commands init
```

## Security Considerations

### Security Recommendations for Third-party Commands

**Verify Command Sources**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only install commands from trusted authors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Check command ratings and community feedback
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid installing commands with overly broad permissions

**Command Permission Control**:
- ‚úÖ Prefer project scope installation
- ‚úÖ Regularly audit installed commands
- ‚úÖ Keep commands updated to latest versions
- ‚úÖ Remove unused commands

## Developing Custom Commands

### Complete TOML Configuration Specification

#### Basic Configuration Structure

```toml
# Command description (required)
description = "Brief command description"

# Command prompt (required)
prompt = """
Complete prompt content sent to AI model
Supports multi-line text and special placeholders
"""
```

#### Advanced Feature Specifications

##### 1. Parameter Injection Mechanism

**Shortcut Parameter Injection**: Use `{{args}}` placeholder

```toml
description = "Code review tool"

prompt = """
Please review the following code and provide improvement suggestions:

{{args}}

Focus on: code quality, security, performance optimization.
"""
```

**Default Parameter Handling**: If not using `{{args}}`, system automatically appends user input to prompt

```toml
description = "Documentation generator"

prompt = """
Generate professional documentation based on provided content.
"""
# User input "/docs User Manual" becomes:
# "Generate professional documentation based on provided content.\n\n/docs User Manual"
```

##### 2. Shell Command Integration

Use `!{command}` syntax to execute Shell commands in prompts:

```toml
description = "Project analysis tool"

prompt = """
Current project information:

File structure:
!{find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" | head -20}

Git status:
!{git status --porcelain}

Please analyze project status and provide suggestions.
"""
```

**Security Mechanisms**:
- Shell commands require security checks
- Support global and session-level command whitelists
- Dangerous commands require user confirmation

##### 3. Prompt Processor Chain

System uses processor chain pattern to handle TOML configuration:

| Processor | Trigger Condition | Function |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **ShellProcessor** | Contains `!{...}` | Execute Shell commands and replace output |
| **ShorthandArgumentProcessor** | Contains `{{args}}` | Replace argument placeholders |
| **DefaultArgumentProcessor** | Default | Append user input to prompt |

### Development Environment Setup

#### Directory Structure Management

```bash
# Global command directory
~/.iflow/commands/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-command.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code-reviewer.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-analyzer.toml

# Project command directory
/path/to/project/.iflow/commands/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-runner.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build-helper.toml
```

#### Path Resolution Rules

System uses the following functions to get command directories:

```typescript
// Global command directory
getUserCommandsDir(): string {
  return path.join(os.homedir(), '.iflow', 'commands');
}

// Project command directory
getProjectCommandsDir(projectRoot: string): string {
  return path.join(projectRoot, '.iflow', 'commands');
}
```

#### File Naming Conventions

- **Basic Naming**: `command-name.toml`
- **Hierarchical Naming**: `parent:child.toml` ‚Üí Creates nested command structure
- **Filename Cleanup**: Non-alphanumeric characters converted to hyphens
- **Extended Namespace**: Extended commands automatically get `[extensionName]` prefix

### Practical Development Examples

#### Example 1: Simple Information Query Command

```toml
# ~/.iflow/commands/system-info.toml
description = "Display system information summary"

prompt = """
Please perform the following system checks and provide a summary:

Operating System: !{uname -a}
Disk Usage: !{df -h /}
Memory Usage: !{free -h}
Current Directory: !{pwd}

Please analyze system status and provide suggestions.
"""
```

Usage: `/system-info`

#### Example 2: Parameterized Code Generator

```toml
# ./iflow/commands/generate-component.toml  
description = "React component generator"

prompt = """
Please generate a React component with the following requirements:

{{args}}

Please include:
1. TypeScript interface definitions
2. Complete component implementation
3. Basic CSS styles
4. Usage examples

Follow best practices and modern React patterns.
"""
```

Usage: `/generate-component User login form component`

#### Example 3: Complex Project Management Tool

```toml
# ./.iflow/commands/project:status.toml
description = "Comprehensive project status analysis"

prompt = """
Comprehensive project status report:

## Repository Status
Git branch: !{git branch --show-current}
Uncommitted changes: !{git status --porcelain | wc -l}
Recent commits: !{git log --oneline -5}

## Dependency Status  
Package.json exists: !{test -f package.json && echo "‚úÖ Exists" || echo "‚ùå Not found"}
Node modules status: !{test -d node_modules && echo "‚úÖ Installed" || echo "‚ùå Not installed"}

## Code Quality
TypeScript files: !{find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | wc -l}
JavaScript files: !{find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" | wc -l}
Test files: !{find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" | wc -l}

Please analyze project health and provide improvement suggestions.
"""
```

Usage: `/project:status`

#### Example 4: Dynamic Script Executor

```toml
# ~/.iflow/commands/run-with-context.toml
description = "Execute commands in project context"

prompt = """
Execute specified operations in current project environment:

Project root directory: !{pwd}
Operation content: {{args}}

Execution result:
!{{{args}}}

Please analyze execution results and provide follow-up suggestions.
"""
```

Usage: `/run-with-context npm test`

### Debugging and Testing Guide

#### Configuration Validation

System uses Zod for TOML configuration validation:

```typescript
const TomlCommandDefSchema = z.object({
  prompt: z.string({
    required_error: "The 'prompt' field is required.",
    invalid_type_error: "The 'prompt' field must be a string.",
  }),
  description: z.string().optional(),
});
```

#### Common Errors and Solutions

| Error Type | Cause | Solution |
|------------|-------|----------|
| `TOML parsing error` | Incorrect syntax | Check quotes, indentation, and escape characters |
| `Schema validation failure` | Missing required fields | Ensure `prompt` field is included |
| `Shell command blocked` | Security policy restrictions | Add to command whitelist or modify security config |
| `Command not showing` | Incorrect file location | Check file path and restart CLI |

#### Development Workflow

1. **Create TOML file**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./.iflow/commands
   touch ./.iflow/commands/my-command.toml
   ```

2. **Write configuration content**
   ```toml
   description = "Test command"
   prompt = "This is a test command"
   ```

3. **Restart CLI to load new command**
   ```bash
   # Exit current session
   /quit
   # Restart
   iflow
   ```

4. **Test command functionality**
   ```bash
   /my-command Test parameters
   ```

5. **View debugging information**
   ```bash
   /log  # View system logs
   /debug # Enable debug mode
   ```
